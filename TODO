 run as a service; adapt for systemd:
- logging: overhaul and remove timestamps and level trace: delegate to systemd
- overhaul cli system: easy server status and all stuff

- write features/proxy and features/caching modules.
- add wt CONNECT behavior as a config:
webtransport could be Option<Behavior> or like that. 
- review error structure on net
- autogen certs should be a value on config, only happens when true:
so tls field is always created: proper tls gets more frequent

bugs to fix:
- quic connection not ending gracefully as it should be
- host field is kinda buggy when using cloudflare rev. proxy
- address already in use health check not always works (failure only after sigint!).
- connections from browsers mostly dont work:
add a feature advertiser: a small external (ipv4, http2) advertises to upgrade to (ipv6, http3)

after 1st release:
- make docs
