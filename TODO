- add a kind of setup that ensures the health in startup (it must run after logs, before run_server): it must ensure that all keys exist, if not, create them. (this feature must be a setting in the config file)
- make log more detailed (and better formatted for debug, informative for info, and remove duplicated server trace).
- better signal handling
- server management while running, also run as a service,
- make docs

fix or document: path "/example/" does not work on config file, only "/example"
requesting "site.com/////////" does not translate to "site.com" but somewhy "site.com/example///////" does translate to "site.com/example"
....
- add webtransport and all the remaining features (caching... a lot more things) for the first release.
