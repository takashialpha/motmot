- add a kind of setup that ensures the health in startup (it must run after logs, before run_server, this feature must be a setting in the config file)

* keys be autogenerated at tls module (key and certs paths get to be optional, defaults for generated still the same tho)

- server management while running, also run as a service,

* in config for each route: set if its a server or proxy, how to handle each http request, if itll use caching

* caching, webtransport. (for webtransport look at hyperium/h3)
