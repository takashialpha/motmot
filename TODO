- add a kind of setup that ensures the health in startup (it must run after logs, before run_server)
(this feature must be a setting in the config file)
- keys be autogenerated at tls module (they must be trusted, key and certs paths get to be optional)
- better signal handling
- make it also a reverse proxy; check server serving and hosting logic to match that and the most modern features (connection transfering by connection id, and all provided by http3)
- handle all types of http requests (get, post..) correctly
- server management while running, also run as a service,
- make docs

fix or document: path "/example/" does not work on config file, only "/example"
requesting "site.com/////////" does not translate to "site.com" but somewhy "site.com/example///////" does translate to "site.com/example"
....
- add webtransport and all the remaining features (caching... a lot more things) for the first release.
